I've actually created an app for this kind of use case. You can check out BlogHandy (I won't add a link to it, but just google it or add .com)

Basically, all you've got to do is add a little JavaScript code snippet to your static HTML page and it loads the blog. Your client then has a login where they can use a simple writing editor to create their blog posts. It's dead-simple for the client to publish posts (+ there's an SEO Helper integrated for them) and also integrating it into the existing static HTML page will take you only a few seconds. Hit me up if you've got any questions :)
