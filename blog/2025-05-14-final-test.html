#### 1. Why Curb Appeal Matters in Dublin

First impressions count, especially in Dublin’s competitive property market. A thoughtfully designed garden and a pristine driveway can lift your home’s value by up to 10 %, according to recent Irish property reports. Beyond resale price, a welcoming front garden sets the tone every time you arrive home.

#### 2. Designing With Dublin’s Climate in Mind

Our mild, maritime climate shapes plant choices and construction methods:

* **Drainage is king.** Frequent rain means driveways must be laid on a permeable sub‑base (we use Type 3 MOT with geotextile) to avoid pooling and frost heave.
* **Salt‑tolerant greenery.** Coastal winds can burn foliage. We recommend hardy evergreens like *Griselinia littoralis* and flowering shrubs such as *Hydrangea paniculata* that thrive in salty air.
* **Low‑mow lawns.** A dwarf ryegrass‑fescue mix stays emerald‑green without weekly cutting—ideal for busy city life.

#### 3. Paving Options That Deliver Style & Strength

| Material                       | Look                       | Lifespan    | Best For                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| **Granite Setts**              | Classic Dublin streetscape | 50 + years  | Heritage homes in D6 & D4   |
| **Porcelain Slabs**            | Sleek, contemporary        | 25–30 years | Roof terraces & courtyards  |
| **Cobble‑lock**                | Textured, rustic           | 20 years    | Driveways needing curves    |
| **Pattern‑Imprinted Concrete** | Mimics stone/brick         | 20 years    | Budget‑friendly large areas |

**Pro tip:** Seal porcelain and concrete within 30 days of installation—the sealant blocks algae stains, a common issue in Dublin’s damp winters.

#### 4. Sustainable Practices We Swear By

* **Rain‑garden borders** soak up run‑off, easing pressure on Dublin’s Victorian sewers.
* **Recycled aggregates** from local demolition sites lower the project’s carbon footprint.
* **LED uplighting** extends garden use after dark while keeping electricity bills low.

#### 5. Spotlight on a Recent Rathmines Makeover

> “Our 1930s semi went from drab to dazzling in two weeks. The team replaced broken concrete with granite setts, added a cedar‑slat fence, and planted lavender borders that smell amazing every time we step outside.”\
> — *Sarah M., Rathmines*

Key stats:

* 48 m² of old concrete removed and recycled
* 12 m³ of permeable stone sub‑base installed
* Zero surface water discharge—fully compliant with Dublin City Council SuDS guidelines

#### 6. Maintenance Cheat‑Sheet

1. **Sweep monthly** to keep moss at bay.
2. **Soft‑wash annually** with a biodegradable cleaner.
3. **Top‑up jointing sand** in cobble‑lock every two years.
4. **Trim planting** in early March before spring growth spurts.
